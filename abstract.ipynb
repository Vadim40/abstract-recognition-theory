Community service is not wasting your time when you could be home playing Video games. It's a time when u give up your time to help someone or something in need. I feel that community service would improve some kids self-confidence. When most people do it they were forced by the school or they were with their friends, and they didn't want to be left out. Well that's not how that should be we should take the responsibility to get up and do it.
